Summary of Changes for app/myprojects/page.tsx (Current Session)
Initial Problem:
The /myprojects page was not loading project cards, stuck in a loading state, and eventually, we identified a "TypeError: Failed to fetch" error originating from the fetchProjects function. This was due to issues with the Supabase query.
Debugging and Key Fixes Implemented:
Auth Logic Refinement:
Corrected how authUser is derived from useAuth() (using session?.user) to resolve persistent issues where authUser was undefined when fetchProjects was called.
Refined useEffect dependencies and logic to correctly trigger data fetching after authentication is confirmed.
Introduced isLoadingProjects state separate from authLoading.
Supabase Query in fetchProjects:
Simplified Query: Initially, the Supabase query in fetchProjects was drastically simplified to select only id, name, owner_user_id to isolate the "TypeError: Failed to fetch". This confirmed the basic connection and fetch worked.
Restored Core Fields: Gradually added back essential fields: owner_user_id, project_brief, status, badge2, badge3, badge4, badge5, created_at.
project_slug Issue: Identified that the projects.project_slug column (which we were trying to select) does not exist in your Supabase projects table, causing a "column does not exist" error.
Removed project_slug from the select() statement.
Made project_slug optional in the ClientProject interface (project_slug?: string | null;).
Removed attempts to map p.project_slug in transformedProjects.
ClientProject Interface and Data Mapping:
Adjusted the mapping in fetchProjects to correctly populate the ClientProject objects with the available data, providing defaults (null or false) for fields not directly fetched (like url, logo_url, is_featured, is_public after project_slug was removed).
Ensured user_id in ClientProject is populated (using p.owner_user_id) for compatibility with delete logic.
Set currentUserRole to ProjectRole.Owner if p.owner_user_id matches the logged-in user.
Mapped p.status to badge1.
UI and Functionality on Project Cards (SortableProjectCard):
Card Layout (Max Width): Changed the grid class from md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 to grid-cols-1 to make project cards span the full available width.
Link Updates (Post-project_slug removal): Since project_slug is unavailable, updated links that previously used it to now use project.id (the project's UUID):
Project name link: href={/myprojects/${project.id}}
General "Edit Project Details" icon link: href={/myprojects/${project.id}/edit}
"Open Project Page" button link: href={/myprojects/${project.id}}
Current State as of this Summary:
The /myprojects page successfully loads and displays project cards.
The "TypeError: Failed to fetch" and "column projects.project_slug does not exist" errors are resolved.
Project cards are full-width.
Links on the project cards now use project UUIDs (e.g., /myprojects/your-uuid-here).
New Issue: Navigating to an individual project page (e.g., /myprojects/your-uuid-here) results in an "Error Loading Project: Project not found or you do not have access." This indicates the individual project page component needs to be updated to fetch data using the UUID from the URL.
We discussed your preference for human-readable slugs (e.g., /myprojects/project-name) over UUIDs, and this is the next major item to address once the individual project pages are accessible via ID.
