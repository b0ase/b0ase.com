# Project To-Do List

- [ ] **Database:** Apply migrations to add `status` and `preview_deployment_url` columns to `clients` table and create `site_settings` table.
- [ ] **Workflow:** Test the preview deployment workflow:
    - [ ] Add an external preview URL (e.g., Vercel) to a project via `/admin/projects`.
    - [ ] Verify the "Next (1-4 Weeks)" iframe on `/projects/[slug]` loads this URL correctly.
    - [ ] Verify the "Now (Live)" iframe on `/projects/[slug]` still loads the `website` URL.
- [ ] **Cleanup:** Remove the `/previews/*` route and related files (`app/previews/layout.tsx`, `app/previews/[slug]/page.tsx`) once the new workflow is confirmed.
- [ ] **Git:** Resolve the Git push issue (local branch behind remote). Fetch/pull from `origin main` and then push.
- [ ] **Bug:** Investigate and fix the "Invalid <Link> with <a> child" error (Need to identify the source page/component).
