# Project To-Do List

- [x] ~~**Database:** Apply migrations to add `status` and `preview_deployment_url` columns to `clients` table and create `site_settings` table.~~
- [x] ~~**Workflow:** Test the preview deployment workflow:~~
    - [x] ~~Add an external preview URL (e.g., Vercel) to a project via `/admin/projects`.~~
    - [x] ~~Verify the "Next (1-4 Weeks)" iframe on `/projects/[slug]` loads this URL correctly.~~
    - [x] ~~Verify the "Now (Live)" iframe on `/projects/[slug]` still loads the `website` URL.~~
- [x] ~~**Cleanup:** Remove the `/previews/*` route and related files (`app/previews/layout.tsx`, `app/previews/[slug]/page.tsx`).~~
- [x] ~~**Git:** Resolve the Git push issue (local branch behind remote). Fetch/pull from `origin main` and then push.~~
- [x] ~~**Bug:** Investigate and fix the "Invalid <Link> with <a> child" error (Checked `/projects/[slug]` page - Link is correct there. Monitor if error reappears elsewhere).~~ - **RESOLVED** Feature duplication issue fixed.
