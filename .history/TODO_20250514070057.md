# Project To-Do List

- [x] ~~**Database:** Apply migrations to add `status` and `preview_deployment_url` columns to `clients` table and create `site_settings` table.~~
- [x] ~~**Workflow:** Test the preview deployment workflow:~~
    - [x] ~~Add an external preview URL (e.g., Vercel) to a project via `/admin/projects`.~~
    - [x] ~~Verify the "Next (1-4 Weeks)" iframe on `/projects/[slug]` loads this URL correctly.~~
    - [x] ~~Verify the "Now (Live)" iframe on `/projects/[slug]` still loads the `website` URL.~~
- [x] ~~**Cleanup:** Remove the `/previews/*` route and related files (`app/previews/layout.tsx`, `app/previews/[slug]/page.tsx`).~~
- [x] ~~**Git:** Resolve the Git push issue (local branch behind remote). Fetch/pull from `origin main` and then push.~~
- [x] ~~**Bug:** Investigate and fix the "Invalid <Link> with <a> child" error (Checked `/projects/[slug]` page - Link is correct there. Monitor if error reappears elsewhere).~~ - **RESOLVED** Feature duplication issue fixed.
- [ ] **Google Sheets Integration:** Debug the `POST /api/google/export-transactions` 401 "invalid_grant" error. This might be related to OAuth scope changes or token issues.
- [ ] **Team Page - Add New Member:** Investigate why the user selection dropdown in the "Add New Member" form on `/team` is appearing empty despite users being present in the `profiles` table (e.g., `ninjapunkgirls`). Check data fetching in `fetchPlatformUsers` and the rendering logic in `app/team/page.tsx`.

# New Feature Requests & Enhancements

## User & Team Management
- [ ] **Team Page - Enhanced Functionality:**
    - [ ] Allow Project Managers (e.g., `richardwboase@gmail.com`) to assign existing platform users (freelancers, other workers) to their client projects via the `/team` page.
    - [ ] Define and implement permissions/views for different user roles (Client, Project Manager, Team Member) within a project context.
    - [ ] Solidify "ultimate permissions" for specified super admin users like `richardwboase@gmail.com`.
- [ ] **Profile Pictures:** Implement profile picture upload, storage (e.g., Supabase Storage), and display for users.
- [ ] **Role-Based Visuals (Badges/Colors):**
    - [ ] Design a system for assigning multiple roles/skills to users (e.g., "Client", "Graphic Designer", "CFO").
    - [ ] Implement visual indicators (colors, badges) for these roles on user profiles and in team selection UIs.

## Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Additional OAuth Providers:**
    - [ ] Investigate and integrate more Supabase OAuth login options (e.g., GitHub, X.com, wallet-based logins). Prioritize those with straightforward setup.
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Auth Issues (Safari/Brave):**
    - [ ] Investigate and fix OAuth login/logout inconsistencies in Safari and Brave browsers.
    - [ ] Specifically address the issue where, after logout, re-login automatically selects the previous Google profile without prompting.

## UI & UX Improvements
- [ ] **Logout Button Relocation:** Move the "Logout" button in `UserSidebar.tsx` to a more prominent, non-scrolling position (e.g., top of the sidebar or user menu in a header).
- [ ] **Revert "My " Prefix in Menu:** Remove "My " from sidebar menu items (e.g., "My Diary" -> "Diary", "My Finances" -> "Finances") for general user clarity.
- [ ] **"My Projects" Page - Drag & Drop Prioritization:**
    - [ ] Implement drag-and-drop reordering for projects listed on the `/myprojects` page.
    - [ ] The order should visually signify priority/urgency ("hotness").
- [ ] **Work In Progress (WIP) Page Enhancements:**
    - [ ] **Editable Tasks:** Allow users to edit their tasks directly on the WIP page (e.g., inline editing or via a modal).
    - [ ] **Dynamic Scope Dropdown:** Ensure the "scope" dropdown for new WIP tasks populates with all projects from the current user's "My Projects" list.
    - [ ] **Visual Priority from "My Projects":** Link the project order/urgency from "My Projects" to visual cues (e.g., color-coding, highlighting) for related tasks in the WIP list.
- [ ] **Diary Entry CRUD:** Add "Edit" and "Delete" buttons/functionality to each diary entry.

## Project & Task Management Flow
- [ ] **Automatic Project Listing for Team Members:** If a user is added to a project team (via `project_users`), ensure that project automatically appears on their `/myprojects` page.

## Onboarding & Signup Flow
- [ ] **Join Existing Project During Signup:** Modify the new client/user signup flow (`/signup` or similar) to allow users to select and join an *existing* project (e.g., one pre-created by an admin for them) instead of always creating a new project. This will prevent duplicate project entries like the "Robust-AE" case.

## Data Integrity & Cleanup
- [ ] **Consolidate Duplicate Client Entries:**
    - [ ] **"Robust-AE" vs "robust-ae.com":**
        - Investigate and consolidate duplicate entries for "Robust-AE" / "robust-ae.com" in the `public.clients` table.
        - Ensure the canonical entry (likely "robust-ae.com") is correctly linked in `public.project_users` for all relevant users.
        - Clean up any corresponding duplicate/incorrect entries in `public.project_scopes`.
    - [ ] **"Ninja Punk Girls" vs "ninjapunkgirls.com":**
        - Investigate and consolidate entries for "Ninja Punk Girls" / "ninjapunkgirls.com" in `public.clients` to the canonical name (likely "ninjapunkgirls.com").
        - Ensure correct linkage in `public.project_users`.
        - Clean up corresponding entries in `public.project_scopes`.
- [ ] **Align "b0ase.com Platform" as a Client Project:**
    - [ ] Ensure an entry exists in `public.clients` for "b0ase.com Platform" (or similar canonical name).
    - [ ] Ensure `richardwboase@gmail.com` is linked to this client entry in `public.project_users`.
    - [ ] Verify the existing "b0ase.com Platform" `project_scope` aligns with this client entry by name.
- [ ] **Run Project Scopes Catch-up Script:** After the above data cleanup in `clients` and `project_users`, re-run the SQL script to populate/update `public.project_scopes` to ensure consistency for the WIP dropdown.

## Planning & Admin
- [ ] **Admin Diary/WIP Population:** (For `richardwboase@gmail.com`) Review recent development and populate personal diary and WIP board with tasks and plans for "tomorrow." (Meta-task for user/AI collaboration).
