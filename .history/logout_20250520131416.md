# Logout Redirect Debugging and Roadmap

This document summarizes the efforts to fix the logout functionality, ensuring it reliably redirects users to the landing page (`/`) instead of the login page (`/login`).

## 1. Current Problem

Despite several attempts, the logout process redirects the user to the `/login` page (often with a query parameter like `?from=/profile` and showing a "Redirecting to login..." UI) instead of the intended landing page (`/`). This indicates a race condition where client-side routing/page protection logic (primarily in `ConditionalLayout.tsx` and potentially page-specific hooks like `useProfileData.ts`) reacts to the user becoming unauthenticated and redirects to `/login` before the explicit `window.location.assign('/')` in the logout handlers can take full effect.

## 2. Efforts So Far

### Attempt 1: Initial Verification and Conflicting Listener Removal
*   **Action:**
    1.  Confirmed `handleLogout` functions used `window.location.assign('/')`.
    2.  Corrected `app/(minimal)/skills/page.tsx`'s `onAuthStateChange` listener to not redirect to `/login` on `SIGNED_OUT`.
*   **Outcome:** Issue persisted.

### Attempt 2: Making `signOut` Non-Blocking
*   **Action:** Modified `handleLogout` functions to call `supabase.auth.signOut()` without `await` and then immediately call `window.location.assign('/')`.
*   **Outcome:** Still redirected to login, sometimes showing "Redirecting to login..." UI (from `ConditionalLayout.tsx`).

### Attempt 3: Using `sessionStorage` Flag (`isLoggingOut`)
*   **Action:**
    1.  `handleLogout` functions in `UserSidebar.tsx` and `ConditionalLayout.tsx` now set `sessionStorage.setItem('isLoggingOut', 'true')` before `window.location.assign('/')`.
    2.  `ConditionalLayout.tsx` was modified to:
        *   Read this flag into a `justLoggedOut` variable at the start of its render.
        *   Remove the flag from `sessionStorage`.
        *   Change its app page protection logic to `if (isAppPage && !isAuthenticated && !justLoggedOut)` to prevent redirecting to `/login` if `justLoggedOut` is true.
    3.  `lib/hooks/useProfileData.ts` (used by `/profile`) was modified in its `fetchInitialUser` function to also check `sessionStorage.getItem('isLoggingOut') === 'true'` and return early (not redirecting to `/login`) if true.
*   **Outcome:** The "Redirecting to login..." UI (from `ConditionalLayout.tsx`) is still observed, and the user is redirected to `/login`. This implies the `!justLoggedOut` condition in `ConditionalLayout.tsx` is not effectively preventing the redirect during the logout sequence at the critical moment. The console log `[ConditionalLayout] Path /profile did not match any specific layout conditions...` appearing *after* other logout-related logs is puzzling and might indicate multiple re-renders or complex state interactions.

## 3. Potential Underlying Problems & Why Attempts Might Fail

1.  **Timing of `sessionStorage` Flag and `ConditionalLayout` Re-render:**
    *   `ConditionalLayout` re-renders when `isAuthenticated` (derived from `useAuth`'s `clientSession`) becomes `false`.
    *   The `justLoggedOut` flag (read from `sessionStorage`) might not be "seen" as true by `ConditionalLayout` during the very first re-render triggered by the auth state change. The sequence could be:
        1. `handleLogout` calls `signOut()`.
        2. `handleLogout` sets `sessionStorage.setItem('isLoggingOut', 'true')`.
        3. `handleLogout` calls `window.location.assign('/')`.
        4. `useAuth` updates, `clientSession` becomes `null`.
        5. `ConditionalLayout` re-renders *due to `clientSession` change*. At this point, does it read the `sessionStorage` item *before* its redirect logic is evaluated? If the `sessionStorage` read happens too late within the render cycle or if there's a subtle timing issue with state updates propagation, the `!justLoggedOut` check might fail to prevent the redirect.
2.  **Multiple Re-renders & State Propagation:** The logout event triggers state changes in `useAuth`, which then flow to `ConditionalLayout` and other components like `UserSidebar` (which has its own `onAuthStateChange`). The interplay of these re-renders might lead to the redirect logic in `ConditionalLayout` being evaluated under conditions where `justLoggedOut` is effectively false or not yet properly processed for that specific render pass that leads to the redirect UI.
3.  **`window.location.assign('/')` vs. `router.push()` / `window.location.href`:** While `window.location.assign('/')` is a strong directive for a full page load, if a client-side `window.location.href = '/login?from=...'` (as used in `ConditionalLayout`) executes very quickly due to React's rendering, it could still beat or interrupt the full navigation.

## 4. Roadmap for Diagnosis, Testing, and Robust Implementation

### Phase 1: Isolate the Source & Timing of the `/login` Redirect (Focus on `ConditionalLayout`)

1.  **Comprehensive `onAuthStateChange` Audit:** (Partially completed)
    *   **Status:** Identified key listeners. `useProfileData.ts` and `app/(minimal)/skills/page.tsx` have been modified to respect the `isLoggingOut` flag in their initial load/auth check logic. `UserSidebar.tsx`'s listener also tries to redirect to `/`.
    *   **Focus:** The interaction between these and `ConditionalLayout` remains the primary concern.
2.  **Intense Scrutiny of `ConditionalLayout.tsx` Behavior (Next Immediate Step):**
    *   **Action:** Add even more granular logging within `ConditionalLayout.tsx` to trace the exact state of `clientSession`, `isAuthenticated`, `justLoggedOut`, and `pathname` *immediately before* the redirect block `if (isAppPage && !isAuthenticated && !justLoggedOut)` is evaluated, and log when the redirect is actually triggered.
    *   **Modify the `justLoggedOut` check:** Instead of reading it once at the top, re-evaluate `sessionStorage.getItem('isLoggingOut') === 'true'` *directly* within the `if (isAppPage && !isAuthenticated && !(sessionStorage.getItem('isLoggingOut') === 'true'))` condition. This ensures the very latest value is used, bypassing potential React state update delays for the `justLoggedOut` variable. (And still remove it if true).
    *   **Goal:** Confirm if `sessionStorage.getItem('isLoggingOut')` is `true` at the precise moment the redirect condition is checked during the logout-triggered re-render.
3.  **Review Page-Specific Authentication Guards (Ongoing):**
    *   **Status:** `useProfileData.ts` modified. Other pages using similar direct auth checks need to be audited if the problem persists after fixing `ConditionalLayout`.

### Phase 2: Strengthen Logout Flow Control (If Phase 1 still fails)

1.  **Force Early Exit in `ConditionalLayout` if Logging Out:**
    *   **Action:** If `sessionStorage.getItem('isLoggingOut') === 'true'` is found at the very beginning of `ConditionalLayout`, immediately return a minimal "Logging out..." component or `null`. This should prevent *any* further rendering logic of `ConditionalLayout`, including its redirect checks, from executing.
    *   **Example:**
        ```typescript
        export default function ConditionalLayout({ children }: ConditionalLayoutProps) {
          if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && sessionStorage.getItem('isLoggingOut') === 'true') {
            console.log('[ConditionalLayout] Detected isLoggingOut flag, rendering minimal logout UI and halting further processing.');
            // Optional: sessionStorage.removeItem('isLoggingOut'); // Remove immediately or let page unload handle it.
            return <div style={{/* simple full screen logging out message */}}>Logging out...</div>;
          }
          // ... rest of ConditionalLayout (setup hooks, other logic)
        }
        ```
    *   This is a more aggressive approach to ensure `ConditionalLayout` doesn't interfere.
2.  **Alternative State for "Logging Out" (If `sessionStorage` is problematic):**
    *   Consider a simple, global, synchronous state (e.g., a global variable `window.isLoggingOut = true;`) set by `handleLogout`. While generally discouraged, for such a transient, critical state, it might offer more immediate consistency across rapidly re-rendering components than `sessionStorage` or even React context/Zustand if there are update timing issues. Reset on page load. (Use with extreme caution).

### Phase 3: Testing and Verification Strategy (Continuous)

*   Continue iterative testing with enhanced logging, focusing on the console output from `ConditionalLayout` and any other identified problematic components.
*   Use browser developer tools (Network tab, Debugger) to trace execution flow.

### Ultimate Goal:
*   A logout process where the `handleLogout` action's `window.location.assign('/')` is the undisputed final navigation step, and all other auth-related logic defers to it during an explicit logout.

By focusing on the precise timing and state within `ConditionalLayout.tsx` when the `isAuthenticated` state changes during logout, we should uncover why the `isLoggingOut` flag isn't preventing the redirect.
