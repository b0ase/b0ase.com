# Logout Redirect Debugging and Roadmap

This document summarizes the efforts to fix the logout functionality, ensuring it reliably redirects users to the landing page (`/`) instead of the login page (`/login`).

## 1. Current Problem

Despite several attempts, the logout process redirects the user to the `/login` page instead of the intended landing page (`/`). This is due to a race condition where `ConditionalLayout.tsx` re-renders quickly after logout is initiated. An initial render correctly identifies the logout process via a `sessionStorage` flag (`isLoggingOut`) and attempts to show a "logging out" UI. However, it prematurely removed this flag. A subsequent rapid re-render, occurring before `window.location.assign('/')` completes, then fails to see the flag, assumes the user is simply unauthenticated on an app page, and incorrectly redirects to `/login`.

## 2. Efforts So Far

### Attempt 1: Initial Verification and Conflicting Listener Removal
*   **Action:** Confirmed `handleLogout` used `window.location.assign('/')`. Corrected `app/(minimal)/skills/page.tsx` listener.
*   **Outcome:** Persisted.

### Attempt 2: Making `signOut` Non-Blocking
*   **Action:** `handleLogout` calls `signOut()` without `await`, then `window.location.assign('/')`.
*   **Outcome:** Still redirected to login.

### Attempt 3: Using `sessionStorage` Flag (`isLoggingOut`) - Initial Implementation
*   **Action:** `handleLogout` set `isLoggingOut`. `ConditionalLayout` and `useProfileData` checked this flag. `ConditionalLayout`'s check was `if (isAppPage && !isAuthenticated && !justLoggedOut)`.
*   **Outcome:** "Redirecting to login..." UI still shown.

### Attempt 4: Aggressive Early Exit in `ConditionalLayout` (with premature flag removal)
*   **Action:** Added a top-level check in `ConditionalLayout.tsx`: if `sessionStorage.getItem('isLoggingOut') === 'true'`, show minimal logout UI and return. This check *also initially removed the flag*.
*   **Console Log Analysis:**
    *   `[ConditionalLayout] TOP LEVEL: Detected isLoggingOut flag...` (Correctly fired)
    *   This was followed by `[ConditionalLayout] Pre-redirect check... isCurrentlyLoggingOut: false`
    *   Then `[ConditionalLayout] EXECUTING REDIRECT to /login...`
*   **Finding:** The top-level check in `ConditionalLayout` (and a similar check later in its logic) was *prematurely removing* the `isLoggingOut` flag from `sessionStorage`. A rapid re-render of `ConditionalLayout` would then no longer see the flag, leading it to believe a normal unauthenticated access to an app page was occurring, thus redirecting to `/login`.
*   **Fix Applied (Latest):** Modified `ConditionalLayout.tsx` to *read* the `isLoggingOut` flag (in both its top-level check and the later conditional block) but **not remove it**. The flag will persist until the `window.location.assign('/')` navigation completes.

## 3. Potential Underlying Problems & Why Attempts Might Fail (Prior to current fix)

1.  **Timing of `sessionStorage` Flag and `ConditionalLayout` Re-render:** The core issue was `ConditionalLayout` removing the flag too soon, then re-rendering and acting based on the flag's absence before the primary logout navigation (`window.location.assign('/')`) could complete.

## 4. Roadmap for Diagnosis, Testing, and Robust Implementation

### Phase 1: Isolate the Source & Timing of the `/login` Redirect (Focus on `ConditionalLayout`)

1.  **Comprehensive `onAuthStateChange` Audit:** (Completed)
2.  **Intense Scrutiny of `ConditionalLayout.tsx` Behavior:**
    *   **Status (Latest):** Identified premature `sessionStorage.removeItem('isLoggingOut')` in `ConditionalLayout.tsx` as the cause of the race condition.
    *   **Action (Latest):** Modified `ConditionalLayout.tsx` to *not* remove the `isLoggingOut` flag. It now only reads it to determine if it should halt and display a "logging out" message.
    *   **Goal:** Verify with testing that this prevents the erroneous redirect to `/login`.
3.  **Review Page-Specific Authentication Guards:** (Ongoing, `useProfileData.ts` modified).

### Phase 2: Strengthen Logout Flow Control (If current fix is insufficient - contingency)

1.  **Alternative State for "Logging Out":** (Contingency) Consider a simple, global, synchronous state if `sessionStorage` continues to be problematic despite not being removed prematurely by `ConditionalLayout`.

### Phase 3: Testing and Verification Strategy (Continuous)

*   Test the latest change: logout and observe console logs and final redirection.
*   Confirm that the `[ConditionalLayout] TOP LEVEL: Detected isLoggingOut flag...` appears, and that no subsequent redirect to `/login` is executed by `ConditionalLayout`.
*   Confirm the user is redirected to `/` (landing page).

### Ultimate Goal:
*   A logout process where the `handleLogout` action's `window.location.assign('/')` is the undisputed final navigation step.

The current hypothesis is that by preventing `ConditionalLayout.tsx` from prematurely removing the `isLoggingOut` flag, it will consistently defer to the logout process, allowing `window.location.assign('/')` to successfully redirect to the landing page.
