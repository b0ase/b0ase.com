**Subject: Whitelabelling a Website: Step-by-Step Guide & Implementation**

**Summary:**

This session focused on the process of whitelabelling the existing web application. The goal was to make the application appear as if it were a native part of a client's brand, primarily by allowing customization of logos, color schemes, and potentially domain names.

**Key Activities & Decisions:**

1.  **Conceptual Planning:**
    *   Defined what "whitelabelling" means in the context of this project.
    *   Identified key visual elements that would need to be customizable (logo, primary/secondary colors, favicons).
    *   Discussed potential mechanisms for clients to input their branding information (e.g., a settings panel, configuration files).

2.  **Asset Replacement Strategy:**
    *   Focused on replacing the default application logo (`b0ase.png` or `logo-dark.png`) with client-specific logos.
    *   Determined that the logo in the `AppNavbar` was the primary target for this session.

3.  **Technical Implementation (Partial/Initial):**
    *   The primary approach involved modifying the `AppNavbar.tsx` component.
    *   Logic was introduced to conditionally render a client's logo if available, falling back to a default logo.
    *   This likely involved fetching a logo URL or path from a configuration source or user profile data.
    *   Considered how to handle different logo versions (e.g., for light and dark themes), though this might not have been fully implemented in this session.

4.  **Documentation/Guidance:**
    *   A `whitelabel-instructions.md` file was created or updated to guide the process. This document likely outlined:
        *   Where to place custom logo files.
        *   How to name them for the system to pick them up.
        *   Any necessary configuration steps.
        *   Perhaps notes on image dimensions or formats.

5.  **Outcome:**
    *   Made initial progress on enabling logo whitelabelling in the `AppNavbar`.
    *   Established a set of instructions for users/admins to customize the application's branding, starting with the logo.

**Action Items/WIP (at the end of this session):**

*   Extend whitelabelling to other parts of the application (e.g., favicons, email templates if any).
*   Implement color scheme customization.
*   Develop a more robust system for managing client branding assets and configurations (potentially a UI for clients).
*   Test the whitelabelling thoroughly with different logo sizes and types.

**Learnings:**

*   Understood the basic steps involved in visual whitelabelling for a web app.
*   Learned how to conditionally render assets in a Next.js/React component.
*   Recognized the importance of clear documentation when implementing customizable features.
