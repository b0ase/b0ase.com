**Subject: Major /team Page Overhaul, Role Management Enhancements, UI Adjustments, and New Feature Planning**

**Summary:**

This intensive period focused on a significant redesign and functional enhancement of the `/team` page, including a Vercel-inspired aesthetic for project management, refined role-based access control (RLAC), and the introduction of drag-and-drop sortability. Key updates were also made to the `AppSubNavbar` default behavior. Additionally, a comprehensive plan for a new "Project Discovery & Bidding" feature for freelancers was developed and documented, though its implementation was deferred.

**Key Developments & Discussions:**

1.  **`/team` Page UI & UX Overhaul:**
    *   **Initial Misunderstanding & Correction:** Shifted from a `/myprojects` card-style UI to restyled expandable "Managed Project" bars, aligning with a Vercel-like design language.
    *   **Visual Enhancements:** Implemented modern styling for project bars (backgrounds, hover effects, icons, status indicators like "MANAGING"/"VIEW MEMBERS").
    *   **Layout Refinement:** Moved the "Add/Update Member" form above the team member list within expanded project bars for improved usability.
    *   **Team Member Display:** Changed to a columnar (stacked) layout for username and role badges for better readability.
    *   **Drag-and-Drop Sortability:** Successfully implemented drag-and-drop reordering for "Managed Project" bars using `@dnd-kit`, including creating a `SortableManagedProjectBar` component and managing client-side order updates.

2.  **Role Management & 'Viewer' Role Implementation:**
    *   **`fetchManagedProjects` Logic:** Updated so Admins see all projects, while non-Admins (e.g., Clients) see projects they own or where they are a 'Client' in `project_members`. This allows clients to manage freelancers on their projects.
    *   **'Viewer' Role Creation:**
        *   Initially addressed an "invalid input value for enum user_role_enum" error by temporarily mapping UI 'Viewer' to DB 'Client'.
        *   Successfully added 'Viewer' as a new value to the `public.user_role_enum` in PostgreSQL via direct SQL execution after API call attempts failed (due to project ID issues).
        *   Updated `handleAddNewMember` in `app/team/page.tsx` to correctly save the 'Viewer' role.
        *   The UI now accurately displays the "VIEWER" role with its distinct styling.
    *   **Pending 'Viewer' Permissions:** Noted that RLS policies defining what a 'Viewer' can actually *see* and *do* are still to be implemented.
    *   **Role Assignment Granularity:** Observed that clients can currently attempt to assign high-level roles (e.g., "Platform Owner"), indicating a need for more granular control over which roles can assign which other roles.

3.  **AppSubNavbar Default State Adjustment:**
    *   **Requirement:** Change the `AppSubNavbar` (distinct from the main `UserSidebar`) to be expanded by default *only* on the `/profile` page and collapsed elsewhere, while retaining manual toggle functionality.
    *   **Implementation:** Modified `app/components/ConditionalLayout.tsx`. The `AuthenticatedAppLayout` sub-component now determines the `initialIsExpanded` prop for `AppSubNavbar` based on `pathname === '/profile'`.
    *   **Linter Error Resolution:** Addressed and fixed linter errors related to incorrect props passed to `AppNavbar` and `AppSubNavbar` within `ConditionalLayout.tsx` through several iterations.

4.  **New Feature Planning: Project Discovery & Bidding for Freelancers:**
    *   **Concept:** Developed a detailed feature outline for a system allowing freelancers to discover available projects and submit bids/applications.
    *   **Key Components of the Plan:**
        *   Database changes for project visibility controls.
        *   A new "Available Projects" page/route for freelancers.
        *   A project detail view for bidding (respecting RLS).
        *   A bidding/application system (new DB table, UI forms).
        *   Bid management interface for clients.
        *   Architectural notes covering DB, RLS, Frontend, and Role implications.
    *   **Documentation:** The feature plan was appended to `todo.md`.
    *   **Status:** Development explicitly deferred to a later stage.

**Overall Outcome:**

*   The `/team` page has been significantly modernized and made more functional, with a clear Vercel-inspired UI and improved UX for managing project members.
*   The 'Viewer' role is now successfully integrated at the database and UI level, with further RLS policy work pending.
*   The `AppSubNavbar` behaves as per the new default state requirements.
*   A solid foundation and plan are in place for a future "Project Discovery & Bidding" feature.
*   Numerous bugs and UI/UX issues were addressed iteratively, particularly concerning component props, conditional rendering, and database interactions.

**Action Items/WIP (Identified or carried over during this period):**

*   Define and implement RLS policies for the 'Viewer' role.
*   Implement more granular controls for role assignments (e.g., prevent clients from assigning 'Platform Owner').
*   Proceed with the development of the "Project Discovery & Bidding" feature when prioritized.
*   Continue monitoring and refining UI/UX across the application.
