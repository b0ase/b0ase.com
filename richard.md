I want to be able to edit hte project page in /myprojects/* jsut like I can edit the project briefs in /myproject/* but there seems to be some 'issue' over how these project pages are made and located and what their paths are. Pay attention to the URL here, I like this style of URL (human readable and instantly identifieale as the project page). Please notice also: it should populate the memerbs of the tgeam in teh section labelled 'Project Team', OK?
